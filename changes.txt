ver 0.20
- Some more mana cost tweaking for spells

ver 0.19
- Removed combat mana slowdown.
- Added minimal STR and DEX requirements to all cloth and leather armor. This is to prevent mages from just stocking up on INT and VIT, thus making the game trivial. May need to cover the option of jewelry as well, but this is it for now.
- Resistances were off. Adjusted them properly for the new resistance gains, and adjusted monster resistances too.
- Changed spell damage to be less spread out. A ratio of 3 between min and max is the highest it goes now.
- Updated some missing text from the 1.023 patch.

ver 0.18
- Rebalanced skills and mana costs. I'd rather err on the side of mana costs too high and slowly adjust them down than the other way around.
- Reduced effect of mana regen items

ver 0.17
- Balanced healer
- Linked greater heal and area heal. Area heal is mostly for multiplayer, and there are too many
  heal spell choices anyway.
- Now greater heal is slow and not that useful during combat. Lesser heal is perfect for combat.
- Some general tweaking, particularly of DoT spells.

ver 0.16
- Balanced warlock
- Linked demons together. This was the only way of making this skill really worthwhile, since demons
  can't co-exist. Otherwise you're trying to convince players to throw points away.
- Re-did all mana costs. I'm really happy with this idea (though I have to test it):
        - Scalable skills can be left at low levels. Therefore their mana costs should shoot up the more levels you buy.
          You can expect to use those skills less as you level them.
        - Non-scalable skills must be taken to the maximum. Therefore their mana costs should rise in such a way
          that you can use those skills as much or more at higher levels.
- Made dark sacrifice's cooldown shorter, and also used damage inflation(deflation) to decrease health cost per level.
        This means that you can either use it several times to get a bigger mana boost, or invest more in it to get a better deal.

ver 0.15
- Balanced necromancer
- Tweaked all single target offensive spells to be stronger in the end game
- Skeletons are now always 2 levels less than the player, skeleton archers 1 level. This helps with not needing to pour points into skeletons just to keep their level up to the player's.
- Really adjusted mana regen rate in combat -- I adjusted the wrong thing before.
- All necromancer creatures now increase in number every 2 levels. 4 levels is too long to wait. Adjusted skill points so that it still works out.
- First time I'm adjusting passive mana bonus with every skill. Not sure 6 was a good enough starting number though.

ver 0.14
- Balanced sorcerer skills
- Changed mana regen rate in combat to 50% instead of 25%. 25% was killing regen rates completely.
  I'm trying 50% for now. May change it to 75% or more.
- There's a problem with the arcane drain's weakness aura. I hope to fix it soon.

ver 0.13
- Balanced magician skills
- Added shrink chance to arcane blast -- magic should have cool effects.
- Made arcane drain cause a weakness aura that decreases physical dmg.
- Made gas explosions use fire explosions

ver 0.12
- Updated to patch 1.023
- Resistance still uses my formula, tweaked for higher resistances
- Removed resistance per spell :( to match main game more
- Changed masteries to give small damage bonus (2-3% instead of 10% per level)

ver 0.11
- Added shrink as a 2% chance to arcane blast
- Switched several powers to use percentages (ice armor, magic shield)
- Tweaked possibly OP ice mage powers: Concentration and Permafrost.

ver 0.10
- Made fire elemental hang about for a shorter time and be 2 levels weaker
- Fixed typo in magician skills
- Tried to prevent fire stacking

ver 0.09
- Tweaked fire mage spells AGAIN.
- Balanced ice mage spells -- remember this is a first try.

ver 0.08
- Reduced requirements for daggers, maces and bows.

ver 0.07
- Tweaked fire mage spells yet again (according to forum feedback)
- Trying for now to have fire mage spells increase fire resistance, decrease cold resistance.
- Capped some really powerful skills.

ver 0.06
- Tweaked fire mage spells some more.
- Stopped using curves for mana growth. Linear functions are good enough.

ver 0.05
- Balanced fire mage skills only
- Fire mastery affects mana costs
- Reverted to NOT use DEX for mana regen. I figure I'm making enough changes as is.

ver 0.04
- Tweak mana regen and mana rates per INT and per SPR for different classes. This won't be felt until the spells are adjusted, since currently mana balance is off for mages.
- Extra mana regen for DEX for mages/priests. This should give a real boost in regen for these classes. DEX should now be worth investing in even for mages that just want to use mana. This is an experimental feature, since it doesn't display properly when you hover over DEX.

ver 0.03
- Change items' critical hit, crushing blow, stunning blow, cast time, deep wounds percentages to be more reasonable.
- Change stealth skill not to give INSANE critical hit bonus per level, but still be effective.

ver 0.02
- Resistance formula tweaks to make it more reasonable
- Resistance of monsters (in general, not specific monsters) changed to fit new formula
- Damage bonus for warriors decreased from 0.2% per tree to 0.15% per tree
